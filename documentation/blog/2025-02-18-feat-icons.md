## ✨ Features

**[#ddf3362](https://github.com/RedonAlla/flexnative/commit/ddf3362) feat(icons): add new icons and update package version**

Added new icons including `lock`, `unlock`, `filet-jsx`, `filet-tsx`, `file-code`, and `folder-open` to the IconName interface and corresponding Unicode values in the icons object. Updated the package version from `0.0.6` to `0.0.7` to reflect these additions. This enhancement expands the available icon set, providing more options for users without impacting existing functionality.
