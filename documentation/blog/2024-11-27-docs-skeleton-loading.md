**[#23fa66a](https://github.com/RedonAlla/flexnative/commit/23fa66a) refactor(skeleton-loading): improve documentation and restructure imports**

Updated the `skeleton-loading` package to version 0.0.2, enhancing the documentation for better clarity and understanding.
Moved dev dependencies from peerDependencies in `package.json`.
Clarified comments and added detailed JSDoc annotations throughout the code to make it more maintainable and comprehensible.
This refactor does not introduce any breaking changes or affect functionality but improves code readability and developer experience.
