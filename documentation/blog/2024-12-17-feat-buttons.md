## ✨ Version 0.0.4

**[#b8d858f](https://github.com/RedonAlla/flexnative/commit/b8d858f) feat(buttons): bump version to 0.0.4**

Modified the button component to enhance rendering behavior. When children are present, they are rendered directly; otherwise, it defaults to rendering ButtonText and ButtonIcon components. This change optimizes the component's flexibility in handling different content scenarios within buttons, improving customization options for developers.

Incremented the package version from `0.0.3` to `0.0.4`.
