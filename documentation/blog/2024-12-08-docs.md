**[#6737291](https://github.com/RedonAlla/flexnative/commit/6737291) feat(navigation): add new `withFancyDrawer` component**

This commit introduces a new `navigation` package within the project. It includes a high-order component, `withFancyDrawer`, which enhances components with animations and styles to simulate a fancy drawer effect. The new package is integrated into the project's structure via updates to the relevant `package.json` files and includes dependencies like `expo-router` and `@react-navigation/drawer`. This addition aims to improve UI interactivity and aesthetics by providing smooth drawer transitions in React Native applications.
