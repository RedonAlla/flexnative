## ✨ Features

**[#4cb6052](https://github.com/RedonAlla/flexnative/commit/4cb6052) feat(icons): add new icons**

Added three new icons: `rocket`, `shield-lock`, and `fingerprint` to the IconName interface and icons object.
Also added a new variant `spinner-ios`.
These updates expand the icon library and address minor typing errors for consistency.

## ✨ Version 0.0.6

**[#8aa3fef](https://github.com/RedonAlla/flexnative/commit/8aa3fef) chore(icons): bump version to `0.0.6`**

Update the package version from `0.0.5` to `0.0.6` in preparation for a new release with improvements or patches. No other changes were made to the package configuration.
