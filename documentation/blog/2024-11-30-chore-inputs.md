## ✨ Version 0.0.4

**[#4bc9101](https://github.com/RedonAlla/flexnative/commit/4bc9101) chore(inputs): bump package version to `0.0.4`**

Update the version of the `@flexnative/inputs` package from `0.0.3` to `0.0.4` to prepare for a new release.
No functional changes were made, but this ensures that downstream dependencies can distinguish this iteration from previous ones.
