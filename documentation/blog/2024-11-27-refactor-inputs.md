**[#8c52c02](https://github.com/RedonAlla/flexnative/commit/8c52c02) refactor(inputs): update default size and theme structure**

Aligned `inputs` with the latest updates in `@flexnative/theme-context` and `@flexnative/icons`. Replaced previous dependencies, utility methods, and constants with new ones from the updated libraries. Updated component styles and logic according to new props and theming guidelines, ensuring consistency across the input components. This includes changes to border radius definitions, color handling, and input styling. Transitioned peer dependencies to devDependencies where applicable, reflecting the updated package structure. The focus was to enhance maintainability and leverage improved theming capabilities from the upgraded dependencies.
