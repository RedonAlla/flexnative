**[#bc3d10d](https://github.com/RedonAlla/flexnative/commit/bc3d10d) feat(layout): add new layout component package**

Introduced a new `@flexnative/layout` package in the project to provide a set of components for screen layout management in React Native applications. This includes the `Block` component, which supports flexible layout properties such as flex, alignment, and gap spacing. The implementation is supported by appropriate TypeScript interfaces and configuration, enhancing modularity and reusability within the application. Additionally, updated existing package files to reflect this inclusion.
