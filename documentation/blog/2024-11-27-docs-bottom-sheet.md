**[#b409a8c](https://github.com/RedonAlla/flexnative/commit/b409a8c) docs(bottom-sheet): enhance documentation strings for components and types**

Updated the JSDoc comments in the `BottomSheet` component files to improve clarity and provide detailed descriptions of each method and property.
The changes include adding more explicit type declarations, refining existing descriptions, and ensuring consistency throughout the documentation.
These updates aim to facilitate better understanding and usability of the code for future developers and maintainers.
No functional logic was altered.
