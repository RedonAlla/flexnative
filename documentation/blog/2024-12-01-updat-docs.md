**[#cbcc692](https://github.com/RedonAlla/flexnative/commit/cbcc692) chore(documentation): add changelog**

Deleted outdated blog entries from the `documentation/blog` directory to streamline the content and focus on current updates.
Added new changelog posts reflecting recent changes and enhancements in various components, such as `tags`, `inputs`, and `bottom-sheet`.
Updated `docusaurus.config.ts` to rename "Blog" to "Changelog" for better clarity and documentation consistency.
This restructuring enhances the project's maintainability by removing obsolete information and highlighting ongoing development progress.
