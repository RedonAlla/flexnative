**[#70ba5d6](https://github.com/RedonAlla/flexnative/commit/70ba5d6) docs: update component documentation and refine theme references**

Updated the documentation for several components, including **badges**, **bottom sheets**, **checkboxes**, and **input** elements.
Changes include updating the last update date, refining descriptions, correcting typos, and ensuring consistent styling options across components by linking them to the default theme file.
Removed duplicate constant definitions by deleting the `ui-constants` file and updated package dependencies to their latest versions for improved stability and new features.
These changes aim to enhance clarity, performance insights, and maintainability of the documentation.
