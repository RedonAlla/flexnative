**[#1634009](https://github.com/RedonAlla/flexnative/commit/1634009) feat(authentication): integrate new authentication package**

Introduced the new `@flexnative/authentication` package to handle user authentication and protecting routes using Expo Router. The package includes React context, custom hooks, type definitions, and utilizes `expo-secure-store` for secure token storage. This integration enhances the security and manageability of authentication processes across the application.
