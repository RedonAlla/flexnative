**[#5bb307f](https://github.com/RedonAlla/flexnative/commit/5bb307f) docs(inputs): add comprehensive JSDoc comments**

This commit adds detailed JSDoc comments to the inputs components, enhancing code readability and developer understanding.
These comments describe the purpose of components, types, interfaces, props, methods, and provide information on styling and behavior.
By including this documentation, the codebase becomes more maintainable and easier for new developers to understand, facilitating a better development workflow and more efficient onboarding.
