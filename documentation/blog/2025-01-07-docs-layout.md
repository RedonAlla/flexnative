## ✨ Version 0.0.6

**[#6f1abf1](https://github.com/RedonAlla/flexnative/commit/6f1abf1) feat(layout): enhance Block component with default flex and padding support**

Updated the `Block` component to include a default flex value of 1 and added a new padding property. This change simplifies the use of the Block component by providing sensible defaults, reducing the need for explicit style definitions. Additionally, the module entry point was specified in package.json, which is now aligned with modern module resolution practices.
