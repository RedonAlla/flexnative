This function is designed to abstract away the complexities of environment-specific storage management, allowing for consistent storage operations across various platforms.

## API

```jsx
import { setStorageItemAsync } from "@flexnative/authentication";
```

## Definition
An asynchronous function named setStorageItemAsync that manages storage operations depending on the environment (web or non-web) and the provided value.

**setStorageItemAsync**
Type: `async function setStorageItemAsync(key: string, value: string | null): Promise<void>`

## Parameters
|  Name   | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| key | `string` | **true** | `undefined` | Representing the identifier for the storage item. |
| value | `string` | **false** | `null` |  Representing the data to be stored or a command to remove the item if `null` |

## Returns
A `Promise<void>`, indicating the asynchronous nature of the function with no return value upon resolution.

## Function Body
1. Environment Check:
    * The function begins by checking if the current execution environment is the web.

2. Web Environment Logic:
    * Try-Catch Block:
A `try-catch` block is used to safely handle any potential errors during local storage operations.
    * Value Check:
      * If `value` is `null`, the function attempts to remove the item associated with the `key` from `localStorage` using `localStorage.removeItem(key)`.
      * If `value` is not `null`, it stores the `key-value` pair in `localStorage` using `localStorage.setItem(key, value)`.
    * Error Handling:
      * If an error occurs during these operations, it logs an error message to the console indicating that local storage is unavailable.

3. Non-Web Environment Logic:
    * For environments other than the web, it uses a secure storage mechanism, likely for mobile or server environments, represented by [`SecureStore`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/securestore/).
    * Value Check:
        * If `value` is `null`, it removes the item associated with `key` using `await SecureStore.deleteItemAsync(key)`.
        * If `value` is not `null`, it saves the `key-value` pair using `await SecureStore.setItemAsync(key, value)`.
