This function abstracts away the complexities of fetching stored items differently based on the execution context, providing a simple and unified API for retrieving data across different environments.

## API
The function asynchronously retrieves an item from storage based on a given key.

```jsx
import { getStorageItemAsync } from "@flexnative/authentication";
```

## Definition
The function asynchronously retrieves an item from storage based on a given key.

**setStorageItemAsync**
Type: `function getStorageItemAsync(key: string): string | null`

## Parameters
|  Name   | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| key | `string` | **true** | `undefined` | Representing the identifier for the item you wish to retrieve from storage. |

## Returns
It returns either a string representing the value of the item if it exists, or null if the item does not exist.

## Function Body
1. Environment Check:
    * The function begins by checking if the current execution environment is the web.

2. Web Environment Logic:
    * If the environment is web, the function attempts to retrieve the item from `localStorage` using the key provided `localStorage.getItem(key)`.
    * `localStorage.getItem(key)` will return the item's value as a string or `null` if the item cannot be found.
    
3. Non-Web Environment Logic:
    * If the environment is not web the function retrieves the item from a secure storage mechanism called [`SecureStore`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/securestore/).
