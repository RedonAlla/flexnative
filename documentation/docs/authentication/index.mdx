A package to implement almost full authentication and protect routes with Expo Router.
`@flexnative/authentication` handles user authentication and protecting routes using Expo Router.
The package includes React context, custom hooks, type definitions, and utilizes [`expo-secure-store`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/securestore/) for secure token storage.
This integration enhances the security and manageability of authentication processes across the application.

The ***FlexNative Authentication*** is part of the **FlexNative** and is available under the `@flexnative/authentication` NPM package.
