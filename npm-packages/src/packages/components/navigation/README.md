Grid is a set of horizontal and vertical lines that divide the mobile app screen into columns and rows.

In React Native this is done using the `Flexbox` algorithm which is designed to provide a consistent layout on different screen sizes. You will normally use a combination of `flexDirection`, `alignItems`, and `justifyContent` to achieve the right layout.

`Block` component it is a wrapper over the React-Native View component. We will exhance this component to support the grid and layout styling using properties that will speed up our development time.
